## Maker Comment (First Comment)
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built this app after seeing the viral Chinese app Sileme (Ты умер?) and realizing how many people live alone and worry about what happens if they can't call for help.

**The Problem:** People living alone can experience emergencies with no one around to notice. This is especially scary for office workers, students, introverts, and anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle.

**The Solution:** A simple check-in every 2 days. One button press confirms you're alive. If you don't check in, your emergency contact gets notified automatically.

**Why I Built This:**
- Completely free (no subscriptions, no hidden fees)
- Privacy-first (all data stored locally on your device)
- Available in 6 languages (EN, ES, DE, FR, RU, ZH)
- Works as a PWA (no app store needed)
- Inspired by a real need I saw in the community

**What's Next:**
- Cross-device sync (coming very soon!)
- Customizable check-in intervals
- Multiple emergency contacts
