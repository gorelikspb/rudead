## Maker Comment (First Comment)
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built this app after seeing the viral Chinese app Sileme (Ты умер? / Are You Dead?) and realizing how many people live alone and worry about what happens if they can't call for help. The Chinese app solves this problem, but requires installation and a paid subscription. So I made a free alternative with these advantages: completely free, no registration required, and available in 6 languages (not just Chinese). 😅

**The Problem:** People living alone can experience emergencies with no one around to notice. This is especially scary for office workers, students, introverts, and anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle.

**The Solution:** A simple check-in every 2 days. One button press confirms you're alive. If you don't check in, your emergency contact gets notified automatically.

**Why I Built This:**
- Completely free (no subscriptions, no hidden fees, no registration) - try it before it's too late! 😅
- Privacy-first (all data stored locally on your device)
- Available in 6 languages (EN, ES, DE, FR, RU, ZH) - truly multilingual
- Works as a PWA (no app store needed)
- Includes funny punchlines for sharing (if you have someone to share with 😅)

**What's Next:**
- Cross-device sync (coming very soon!)
- Customizable check-in intervals
- Multiple emergency contacts

Try it out and let me know what you think! Feedback welcome 🚀
